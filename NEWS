surviplot NEWS


Changes in version 1.1.0 (2017-04-05)

- Modified "cutn" such that it doesn't choke on challenging data (or at least chokes less often).


Changes in version 1.0.0 (2016-08-08)

- This package was formerly called "survplot" (until version 0.0.7) and is now called "surviplot". This was done to avoid confusion with the function "survplot" in the "rms" package.
- Similarly, the function "survplot" is now called "surviplot".


Changes in version 0.0.7 (2012-04-04)

- Unstratified data should now work; see new examples in documentation.
- "cutn" now accepts NAs without complaining, and now does not have an "na.rm" argument.
- New function "addNrisk" for adding number-at-risk to an existing plot.


Changes in version 0.0.6 (2012-02-20)

- Added a NAMESPACE file.


Changes in version 0.0.5 (2011-07-06)

- In "survplot", supplying a list to legend.pos would generate a warning.
- "survplot" now returns HR and P value (as text), invisibly (if there are two groups).


Changes in version 0.0.4 (2010-10-20)

- Updated keywords in function docs
- Modernized this NEWS file (was ChangeLog)
- Changed arg in "survplot": "show.n.risk" is now "show.nrisk".
- Added "color.nrisk" arg in "survplot"
- Moved "Number at risk" label to the left
- Moved number at risk section up one line to take up less space.
- In DESCRIPTION, added link to the survplot web page.


Changes in version 0.0.3 (2009-06-24)

- Added "invert" function.
- "plotsurv": Check length of 'snames'.
- "plotsurv": Automatically trim redundant prefix of 'snames'.
- "plotsurv": Add 'stitle' and 'lwd' arguments.


Changes in version 0.0.2 (2009-04-29)

- "nrisk" was crashing in R-2.9.0 because "survfit.object" changed. 
- "plotsurv" was crashing in R-2.9.0 because "plot.survfit" can no longer make a legend.
- Added "lty" and "legend.pos" arguments to "plotsurv".


Changes in version 0.0.1 (2009-02-20)

- First release.  The functions were all taken from the (not publicly available) "aronmisc" package.
